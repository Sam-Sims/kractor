# kractor

**kra**ken extr**actor**

Kractor extracts reads from fastq `[.gz/.bz2]` files using taxonomic classifications obtained via Kraken2.
It supports single or paired-end reads, can optionally include taxonomic parents or children, and uses minimal memory (~
4.5 MB for a 17 GB FASTQ file).

The end result is a `fast[q/a]` file containing all reads classified as the specified taxon(s).

Kractor significantly enhances processing speed compared to KrakenTools for both paired and unpaired reads.

Performance vs KrakenTools:

- Paired compressed FASTQ: ~21× faster
- Paired uncompressed FASTQ: ~10× faster
- Unpaired: ~4× faster (compressed or uncompressed)

For additional details, refer to the [benchmarks](benchmarks/benchmarks.md)

## Motivation

Provides similar functionality to the [KrakenTools](https://github.com/jenniferlu717/KrakenTools) `extract_kraken_reads`
python script.

However the main motivation was to enhance speed when processing multiple, large FASTQ files - and as a way to learn
Rust.

### Summary statistics

Use `--summary` to get summary statistics (output to stdout on completion)

```json
{
  "taxons_identified": [
    0,
    1
  ],
  "missing_taxon_ids": [
    999999999
  ],
  "reads_extracted_per_taxon": {
    "0": 745591,
    "1": 1646
  },
  "total_reads_in": 3491078,
  "total_reads_out": 747237,
  "proportion_extracted": 0.2140419091180432,
  "input_format": "single",
  "output_format": "fastq",
  "kractor_version": "3.1.0"
}
```

Fields:

- `taxons_identified`: Taxon IDs found in the Kraken report/output based on the requested taxids (includes
  parents/children if used).
- `missing_taxon_ids`: Requested taxon IDs that were not found in the Kraken report.
- `reads_extracted_per_taxon`: Number of reads extracted per identified taxon ID (0 indicates no direct assignments, but
  present due to children/parents).
- `total_reads_in`: Total reads parsed from the input file(s).
- `total_reads_out`: Total reads written to the output file(s).
- `proportion_extracted`: `total_reads_out / total_reads_in`.
- `input_format`: `single` or `paired` input mode.
- `output_format`: `fastq` or `fasta`, depending on `--output-fasta`.
- `kractor_version`: Version of kractor that produced the summary.

### Arguments:

### Required:

#### Input

`-i, --input`

Specifies one or two input FASTQ files to extract reads from. Files may be uncompressed or compressed (`gz`, `bz2`).
Paired end reads can be specified by:

Using `--input` twice: `-i <R1_fastq_file> -i <R2_fastq_file>`

Using `--input` once but passing both files: `-i <R1_fastq_file> <R2_fastq_file>`

#### Output

`-o, --output`

Specifies the output file(s) for extracted reads, matching the order of the input files.
Compression type is inferred from the file extension (.gz, .bz2). If not recognised, output will be uncompressed.

#### Kraken Output

`-k, --kraken`

Path to
the [Standard Kraken Output Format file](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki/Manual#standard-kraken-output-format),
containing taxonomic classification of read IDs.

#### Taxid

`-t, --taxid`

One or more taxonomic IDs to extract.

For example: `-t 1 2 10`

Each taxonomic id is affected by `--exclude`, `--parents`, and `--children` if those options are used.

Taxonomic ids do not need to be present in a given report. This may be useful when running kractor in a wrapper script
for several fastq files and just want to extract a set of taxon ids from them all - without caring if they are present
or not.

### Optional:

#### Output type

`--compression-format`

Manually set output compression format, overriding what is inferred from file names.

Valid values:

- `gz` – gzip compression
- `bz2` – bzip2 compression
- `none` – no compression

#### Compression level

`--compression-level`

Set compression level (1–9).

- 1 = fastest, largest file
- 9 = slowest, smallest file

Default: 2 (balance of speed and size)

#### Output fasta

`--output-fasta`

Output sequences in FASTA format instead of FASTQ.

#### Kraken Report

`-r, --report`

Path to the [Kraken2 report file](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki/Manual#sample-report-output-format).
Required if using `--parents` or `--children`.

The first line is automatically treated as a header if it looks non-numeric; use `--no-header-detect` to force parsing
from the very first line. Parsing errors will include the report line number and offending line to help spot format
issues.

#### Parents

`--parents`

Include reads classified between the root and the specified `--taxid`. Requires `--report`.

#### Children

`--children`

Include reads classified at the given taxid and all its descendant taxa. Requires `--report`.

#### Exclude

`--exclude`

Extract all reads except those matching the given taxids. Can be combined with `--parents` or `--children`.

#### JSON report

`--summary`

Write a JSON report to stdout after processing.
